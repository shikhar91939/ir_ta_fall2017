Weightage: Task1: 60%. Task2: 40%

Deductions:
(Applies for both tasks. Deduct only once is mistake done in both tasks)
Not following crawling directions/ not realizing Task1 is basically BFS: -8
Incomplete URL Lists: -3 – -5) (based on severity)
No politeness: -4
Links containing ':' or '#’:  -5
External links: -2 – -4
Non-existent links: -5
Not handling redirects: -3
More than 1000 URLs: -3 (okay for Task 2 to exclude seed from result list)

(Applies for Task 2)
Trying to filter Task 1 results to obtain focused results for Task2:
-15 (they need to re-crawl, it's called focused *crawling* after all!)
Downloading a page to scan for [rain] then deciding whether to keep or
delete it instead of looking at url and anchor: -8 (that defeats the
purpose of focused crawling)
Looking for keyword in either anchor OR URL but not both: -3

(Handling variations of rain)
Handling [rain] only s first word but not as middle or last word: -3
Considering [rain] as substring in unrelated words (grain): -10 (but,
e.g. [rainbow] is correct]
Not handling letter case variations of rain: -4

*There is no unique correct solution for handling the variations of
rain. Different  combinations of stemming, decompounding, regex,
casefolding, punctuation would work. You should look for a sensical,
non-redundant combination. More inclusive combinations are more
effective (i.e. better). Deduct 2-8 marks if
redundant/unexplained/incorrect implementation.

(General):
-30 for missing code
-15 for missing result file
-10 for missing explanation file in Task2
